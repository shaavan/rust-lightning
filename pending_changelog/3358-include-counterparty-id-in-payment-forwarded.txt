API Updates
===========

To improve clarity and uniqueness in identifying forwarded payments, the `PaymentForwarded` 
event now includes counterparty node IDs alongside `ChannelIds`. This change resolves 
potential ambiguity in cases like v1 0conf channel opens, where `ChannelIds` alone may not 
be unique.
